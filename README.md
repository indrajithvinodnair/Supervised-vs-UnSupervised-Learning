# Supervised-vs-UnSupervised-Learning
A comparative study between supevised &amp; Unsupervised learning methods on a highly imbalanced dataset.
After the basic data processing , undersampling &amp; oversampling techniques are used to make an artifically balanced
dataset. The supervised &amp; unsupervised learning algorithms will be applied to the 
balanced as well as the highly imbalanced dataset and conclusions will be made.

Under Supervised learning, SVM is used &amp; for Un-Supervised learning
Isolation Forest is used.

Afterwards a detailed analysis of the performance of the learning methods
on both the balanced &amp; the highly imbalanced datasets are done, followed
by a conclusion.
